## 🐍 100 Projects in Python

**This repository is my Python learning journey.**


1. I’m learning Python by building 100 small projects, one step at a time.
2. This is not about perfection.
3. It’s about consistency, practice, and improvement.


**🌱 Why I Made This Repo**

- I learn best by doing. So instead of only watching tutorials or reading books, I decided to build projects.


**This repo helps me:**


1. Practice Python daily
2. Turn concepts into real code
3. Track my progress


**Stay motivated**

📌 Final Thought
This repo is for me.
If someone else finds it helpful, that’s a bonus 🙂
Keep going. Don’t stop. Build. Learn. Repeat. 🐍
